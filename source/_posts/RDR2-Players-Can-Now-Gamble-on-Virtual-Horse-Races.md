#  RDR2 Players Can Now Gamble on Virtual Horse Races

The new Red Dead Redemption 2 online update has finally added the much anticipated gambling feature to the game. Players can now visit the in-game casinos and bet on virtual horse races.

There are a few different ways that you can gamble in RDR2. You can place bets on specific horses to win, place bets on how many of the horses will finish in a certain order, or bet on which horse will finish first, second, or third. The payouts for each type of bet vary depending on the odds, but they can be quite lucrative if you know what you're doing.

In order to make money gambling, you'll first need to spend some time learning about the different horses and their stats. Each horse has its own unique set of stats that determines how likely it is to win a race. You'll also want to learn about the different racetracks; some are more difficult than others.

Once you feel comfortable enough to start gambling, head over to one of the in-game casinos and talk to the croupier. She'll explain how to place your bets and give you a chance to practice before putting any real money on the line. Good luck!

Rockstar Games is not the only video game company getting into the virtual sports betting market. Earlier this year, gaming giant Electronic Arts announced that it was launching a new feature called "Vault" that would allow gamers to bet on virtual sports matches.
