#  Live Online Casino Introduces Texas Poker – the Next Big Thing in Gambling

The online casino scene is constantly evolving and new games are being added all the time. One of the newest additions to the scene is Texas Poker, a game that is quickly becoming one of the most popular choices for online casino players.

What is Texas Poker?

Texas Poker is a variant of the classic poker game that is played with a deck of 52 cards. The aim of the game is to collect as many points as possible by forming sets and sequences using any combination of cards from your hand. The player who has the highest score at the end of the game wins.

How to Play Texas Poker

The basic rules of Texas Poker are very simple to learn. In fact, if you already know how to play poker, you will be able to pick up Texas Poker in no time at all. The following steps will give you a brief overview of how to play:

1) Decide how many chips you want to bet – each player begins with 1000 chips.

2) Each player is dealt 5 cards face down.

3) Turn over one of your cards and put it face up on the table – this card is your ‘showdown’ card.

4) Bet (or fold) based on the value of your hand. You can either bet an amount equal to the number of chips in front of you, or make a multiple bet (e.g. 2x your current bet).

5) Showdown! If two or more players remain in the game after all players have either bet or folded, then the players reveal their showdown cards and compare hands accordingly. The player with the highest ranked hand wins all bets placed during that round.
