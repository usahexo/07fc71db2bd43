#  Dodgers emerge as early front runners in NL West race

The Dodgers were among the busiest teams this offseason, making several big moves to bolster their roster. They emerged as early front runners in the NL West race, and they appear to be poised for another playoff run.

They made a big splash by signing star pitcher Clayton Kershaw to a long-term contract. He is coming off another outstanding season, and he is firmly entrenched as the ace of their pitching staff.

They also bolstered their lineup by signing second baseman Brian Dozier and outfielder Curtis Granderson. Dozier is coming off a career year with 42 home runs, and he should provide some much-needed power in the middle of the lineup. Granderson provides veteran leadership and a steadying presence in the outfield.

The Dodgers also made some smaller signings that could end up being key contributors. They signed relievers Ryan Madson and Brandon Morrow, both of whom have extensive playoff experience. Madson served as the A's closer for several years, and Morrow was an All-Star with Toronto last season.

Their biggest question marks heading into the season are their bullpen and defense. The bullpen was shaky last season, and they lost shortstop Corey Seager for most of the year due to injury. Seager is back now, but there are still some question marks surrounding the rest of the infield defense.

Overall, however, the Dodgers look like one of the top contenders in the NL West race. With Clayton Kershaw leading their pitching staff, they should be able to compete with anyone in the division.

#  Giants find themselves trailing early on in NL West

The San Francisco Giants have gotten off to a slow start in the National League West, trailing the Los Angeles Dodgers by 6.5 games early on in the season.

The Giants have had some struggles offensively, scoring just 3.7 runs per game, which is good for 26th in the MLB. They have also had some trouble getting timely hits, with a .269 batting average with runners in scoring position, which is good for 27th in the league.

Some of their struggles can be attributed to injuries, as they have been without Hunter Pence and Brandon Belt for extended periods of time. However, even when those two players have been healthy, the Giants have still struggled to score runs.

On the pitching side of things, the Giants have been solid, posting a 3.48 ERA, which is good for 10th in the MLB. Madison Bumgarner has been his usual dominant self, posting a 2.14 ERA and 0.98 WHIP over his first nine starts.

Despite their lack of success early on in the season, the Giants are still only four games out of first place in a very tight National League West division. If they can get their offense going and get some key players back from injury, they could make a run at the division title down the stretch.

#  Rockies & Diamondbacks looking to keep up with Dodgers

In the National League (NL), the Los Angeles Dodgers have been the team to beat this season. They currently hold a commanding 10-game lead in the NL West division. However, there are two teams who are looking to keep up with the Dodgers and make a run at the playoffs: the Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks.

The Rockies got off to a hot start this season, but they have since cooled off and now sit in second place in the NL West, 7.5 games behind the Dodgers. However, they still have a good chance of making the playoffs, as they are currently in first place in the NL Wild Card standings. The Diamondbacks are in third place in the NL West, but they are only 5 games behind the Dodgers. They also have a good chance of making the playoffs, as they are currently in first place in the NL Wild Card standings.

So far this season, both Colorado and Arizona have been led by theirpitching staffs. The Rockies’ pitching staff has a combined 3.53 ERA, which is sixth best in MLB. The Diamondbacks’ pitching staff has a combined 3.89 ERA, which is eleventh best in MLB.

The Rockies offense has also been productive this season. They rank fifth in MLB in runs scored and eighth in home runs. Nolan Arenado has been their biggest offensive weapon; he ranks fourth in MLB with 24 home runs and leads all of baseball with 106 RBIs. The Diamondbacks offense has been less productive than the Rockies offense; they rank seventeenth in MLB in runs scored and twenty-seventh in home runs. Paul Goldschmidt has been their biggest offensive weapon; he ranks fourth in MLB with 85 RBIs and tenth with a .321 batting average.

Both Colorado and Arizona have playoff aspirations and hope to catch up to or pass the Dodgers before the end of the season.

#  Padres & Dodgers battling for last spot in the division

The San Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers are in a tight race for the last spot in the division. The Padres are currently in the lead, but the Dodgers are not far behind.

The Padres have had a strong season so far, thanks in part to their young talent. Rookie outfielder Manuel Margot has been a standout performer, as has starting pitcher Dinelson Lamet.

The Dodgers have also had a good season, thanks to their All-Star caliber players like Clayton Kershaw and Cody Bellinger. However, they have struggled in recent weeks, which has allowed the Padres to pull ahead.

If the Dodgers want to catch up to the Padres, they will need to start playing better baseball. They cannot afford to fall too far behind, or they may miss out on the playoffs entirely.

The Padres and Dodgers are both very talented teams, and it will be interesting to see who comes out on top.

#  Kershaw leads Dodgers to another NL West title

Clayton Kershaw tossed seven strong innings and Cody Bellinger homered as the Dodgers clinched their sixth consecutive NL West title with a 5-1 victory over the Giants.

It's the third time in four years that Kershaw has led the Dodgers to a division crown. Los Angeles is now on track for a third consecutive trip to the National League Championship Series.

"It feels great," Kershaw said of winning another division title. "We're not done yet, though."

Kershaw (16-5) allowed one run on five hits while striking out six to pick up the victory. He finishes the season with a 2.73 ERA.

"He was Clayton Kershaw tonight," Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. "He gave us what we needed."

Bellinger's solo homer in the fifth inning gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead. They added three more runs in the seventh inning, including an RBI double by Justin Turner and a two-run single by Yasiel Puig.

"This team is amazing," Bellinger said of his Dodgers teammates. "We never give up."

Giants starter Madison Bumgarner (3-9) took the loss, allowing five runs on eight hits in six innings. He finishes the season with a 3.90 ERA.
