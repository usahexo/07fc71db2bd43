The Ghost Walks is set in a small town in upstate New York. It is a very rural area, and the closest town is quite a drive away. The characters in the play are all from this small town, and they all know each other well.

The goal of the game is to connect as many dots on the board as possible. When you have connected 4 dots of the same color, they will disappear and you will earn points for each dot. The more dots you remove at once, the more points youâ€™ll get. If at any time you cannot make a move, the game will end in a tie.

The game is played by connecting dots with a finger. To connect two dots, simply tap on one dot and then tap on another dot that you want to connect it to.
