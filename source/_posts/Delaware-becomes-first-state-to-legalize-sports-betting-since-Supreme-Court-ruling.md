#  Delaware becomes first state to legalize sports betting since Supreme Court ruling

On June 5, 2018, the Supreme Court overturned a federal law that prohibited most states from legalizing sports betting. The 6-3 ruling was seen as a victory by many in the gambling industry, as well as for states seeking to generate new revenue. Delaware became the first state to legalize sports betting after the ruling, with other states expected to follow soon.

Delaware had been offering limited sports betting since 2009, when it was one of six states exempted from the federal law. However, that exemption was later struck down by a lower court. After the Supreme Court's ruling, Delaware moved quickly to pass a new law that would allow full-blown sports betting within its borders.

John Morgan, owner of Dover Downs casino and racetrack in Delaware, said that he believed the state would reap significant benefits from legalized sports betting. "I'm ecstatic," Morgan said. "This is something that needed to happen." He added that he expected his casino to take in an additional $5 million per year in revenue as a result of legalized sports betting.

Governor John Carney also hailed the Supreme Court's decision, stating that it would help create jobs and boost tourism in Delaware. He predicted that the state could earn up to $25 million annually in tax revenue from legalized sports betting.

The NFL and other major pro leagues had opposed the legalization of sports betting, arguing that it would lead to increased cheating and corruption. However, the Supreme Court sided with Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion that there was little evidence to support this claim. "The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice," Alito wrote. "But the choice is not ours to make."

#  New Jersey takes lead in legalizing sports betting, Pennsylvania close behind

On Monday, New Jersey took a major step in becoming the first state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May.

Just hours after the ruling, Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill allowing sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.

"Today, we are finally making the dream of legalized sports betting a reality for New Jersey residents and visitors," Murphy said in a statement. "This is the right move for our state and will allow us to capitalize on this new industry."

Pennsylvania is close behind New Jersey, with lawmakers there expected to vote on a bill legalizing sports betting next week.

The bill would allow casino operators in Pennsylvania to offer sports betting, including online and mobile wagering, pending approval from the state gaming control board.

"We're cautiously optimistic that we have enough votes to pass it," Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Dave Reed told reporters on Tuesday. "We're still whipping the vote and finalizing some language, but I feel comfortable saying that we'll have a vote next week."

If passed, Pennsylvania would become the sixth state to legalize sports betting since the Supreme Court's ruling in May.

#  Sports betting bills introduced in numerous states, but success uncertain

In the past few years, many states have introduced legislation to legalize sports betting. However, the success of these bills is uncertain, as they face opposition from various groups.

Supporters of sports betting argue that it would generate revenue for the state, and would be a boon to the local economy. They also argue that it would be a popular attraction for visitors, and would create jobs.

Opponents of sports betting argue that it would lead to increased gambling addiction, and would damage the integrity of sporting events. They also argue that it would be harmful to consumers, and that the state should not be involved in the gambling industry.

So far, only a few states have legalized sports betting, including Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey. In New Jersey, sports betting has been successful, generating millions of dollars in revenue. However, other states have had more difficulty implementing it.

It remains to be seen whether sports betting will become legal in more states in the coming years. While there is strong support for it, there is also significant opposition, which could prevent its passage.

#  California lawmakers consider sports betting bill amid major gaming expansion

In the year of 2018, major gaming expansions have been occurring in California. There have been discussions about adding sports betting to this mix.

Californian lawmakers are now considering a bill that seeks to authorize sports gambling within the state. The proposed measure would legalize and regulate sports betting at the state's casinos, race tracks, and online. The state is already home to a number of card clubs, which would be allowed to offer sports betting under the proposed bill.

It's no secret that gambling is big business in California. In fact, commercial casino gambling has been legal in the state since 1999. And with total gaming revenue topping $5 billion in 2017, it's clear that Californians love their casino games.

So why the sudden interest in authorizing sports betting? Proponents of the bill say that it would help generate much-needed tax revenue for the cash-strapped state government. They also argue that it would create jobs and promote tourism.

Opponents of the bill counter that legalizing sports betting could lead to increased addiction and social problems. They also express concern that underage gambling could increase if sports betting is legalized.

It remains to be seen whether the proposed measure will pass muster with California lawmakers. But if it does, it could mark a major expansion of gambling in the Golden State.

#  Connecticut could be next state to legalize sports betting


According to a report from the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/14/politics/connecticut-legalize-sports-betting/index.html">Associated Press</a>, lawmakers in Connecticut are considering a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state.

The bill, which was introduced last week, would allow the state's two casinos and its tribal casinos to offer sports betting. It would also allow the state to partner with other states to offer multi-jurisdictional sports betting.

This is not the first time that Connecticut has considered legalizing sports betting. Last year, a similar bill was introduced but it did not make it out of committee.

Legalizing sports betting in Connecticut would be a big win for the state's casinos. In addition to bringing in new revenue, it would also help them compete with the neighboring state of New Jersey, which legalized sports betting last year.

If the bill does pass, it is likely that there will be some resistance from professional sports leagues, who have been vocal opponents of legalized sports betting. The NBA and NFL have both said that they would prefer for Congress to pass a nationwide law legalizing sports betting.
