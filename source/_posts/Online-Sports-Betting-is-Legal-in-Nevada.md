#  Online Sports Betting is Legal in Nevada

Nevada is one of only three states in the US where online sports betting is legal. The Silver State's legalized sports betting industry has been a boon to the state's economy, with over $1.5 billion wagered on sporting events in 2017.

Online sports betting is available through licensed and regulated Nevada casinos. Players can place bets on sporting events through the casino's website or mobile app. All major US sports leagues are offered for betting, including NFL, NBA, MLB, and NCAA football and basketball.

The Nevada Gaming Commission oversees the licensing and regulation of the state's online casinos. The Commission ensures that all casinos offering online sports betting are reputable and compliant with state laws.

Nevada's online sportsbooks offer a wide variety of bet types, including point spreads, moneylines, totals, and parlays. In addition, many of the state's casinos offer prop bets on individual players and games.

Players must be 21 years of age or older to participate in online sports betting in Nevada.

#  Online Sports Betting is Legal in New Jersey

Online sports betting is now legal in the State of New Jersey. Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill into law on Monday, legalizing sports betting in the state.

The new law allows casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, subject to approval from the New Jersey Gaming Commission. Online sports betting will also be available, with bets being placed through casino websites or apps.

"This is another step in the march toward fairness and fiscal sanity in New Jersey," said Governor Murphy. "I am proud to sign legislation that allows us to bring gaming entertainment options to our residents while also creating jobs and generating economic activity."

New Jersey has been pushing for the legalization of sports betting for several years. In 2012, the state challenged a federal ban on sports betting, but lost in court. The new law allows for sporting events to be bet on in person and online, with a list of approved sporting events being released by the gaming commission.

Opponents of the bill argued that it would increase gambling addiction and crime rates, but supporters say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state. A study by Econsult Solutions estimates that legalized sports betting could generate $500 million annually for New Jersey's economy.

Casinos and racetracks have already begun preparations for legalized sports betting, with DraftKings announcing plans to open a sportsbook at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, NJ.
