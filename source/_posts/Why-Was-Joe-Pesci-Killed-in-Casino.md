#  Why Was Joe Pesci Killed in Casino?

It was a question that had been asked by fans of the movie Casino for years. Why did Joe Pesci’s character, Nicky Santoro, have to die? Some speculated that it was due to Pesci’s real life anger issues and penchant for violence. However, casino author Nicholas Pileggi has another explanation.

In an interview with NPR, Pileggi said that the character of Santoro needed to be killed because he “knew too much.” Pileggi explained:

"He was an absolutely necessary character in the structure of the film, because he knew all of the levers inside and outside the casino. But he was also very volatile, and he was also very dangerous. So, it had to be somebody who knew how to handle him, and in the end, it was Sam (Ace) Rothstein."

Pesci had already starred in two other Martin Scorsese movies, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, and had become known as a volatile actor. It’s likely that Scorsese didn’t want to take any chances with his leading man. In the end, it was decided that Santoro would have to die and Pesci left the set after his final scene.

#  Who Killed Joe Pesci in Casino?

In the 1995 Martin Scorsese film Casino, actor Joe Pesci plays mobster Tommy DeVito. In a memorable scene, DeVito is confronted by angry casino owner Frank Rosenthal, who demands to know who killed his brother. DeVito responds with a series of horrifying stories about cartoonish mobsters committing brutal murders.

Many viewers interpreted Pesci's performance as an indication that he was hinting at his own involvement in real-life mob killings. In fact, some have even suggested that Pesci himself killed Rosenthal's brother. However, there is no evidence to support this theory.

There is no doubt that Pesci is a talented actor, and his portrayal of Tommy DeVito is one of the highlights of Casino. However, it's probably best not to take everything he says in the film too seriously!

#  Theories About Who Killed Joe Pesci in Casino

There are many theories about who killed Joe Pesci in the movie Casino. Some people say it was Nicky Santoro, while others believe it was Tony Spilotro. However, the most likely suspect is Frank Rosenthal.

Frank was known for being a hothead and had a history of violence. He was also very close to both Nicky and Tony, which makes him a prime suspect. Additionally, he had a motive - he was cheated out of money by Joe Pesci in the casino.

There is evidence that supports this theory, including testimony from Frank's son and an FBI agent who worked on the case. It's clear that there are numerous possible suspects in Joe Pesci's death, but Frank Rosenthal is the most likely one.

#  Was Frank Rosenthal Responsible for Killing Joe Pesci in Casino?

Frank Rosenthal, also known as “The Fixer”, was a Chicago Outfit associate and casino boss. Some have theorized that he was involved in the death of actor Joe Pesci in the movie Casino.

Pesci had starred in Goodfellas, playing opposite Robert De Niro, who had recommended him for the role in Casino. Pesci’s character is based on real-life gangster Anthony Spilotro, who was killed by the Chicago Outfit. It has been speculated that Rosenthal arranged for Spilotro’s death, and that he may have been behind Pesci’s murder as well.

There is no concrete evidence to support this theory, however. In an interview with Martin Scorsese (director of Casino), Pesci himself said that he didn’t think Rosenthal was responsible for his death. Rosenthal himself has never commented on the matter.

Whether or not Rosenthal was actually involved in Pesci’s death, his career as a mob fixer makes him a controversial figure nonetheless. He was known for his ability to fix problems and disputes between casinos and the mafia, and for his connections to some of the most powerful people in the underworld.

Despite this dark history, Rosenthal has also been credited with helping to make Las Vegas into the gambling powerhouse it is today. He is considered one of the pioneers of modern day gaming, and is responsible for introducing new games like blackjack and craps to Nevada casinos.

Even after his death in 2008, Rosenthal continues to be a source of fascination for many people. His life story is full of intrigue and mystery, and it will likely remain one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in mob history.

#  What Really Happened to Joe Pesci in Casino?

Joe Pesci is a Hollywood legend, but many people don't know what happened to him after his role in the movie Casino. Pesci disappeared from the public eye for years, and there are many rumors about what happened to him. Some say he retired from acting, others say he went into hiding after a falling out with Martin Scorsese. But what really happened to Joe Pesci?

The truth is that Pesci had a nervous breakdown after filming Casino. He was exhausted from filming and doing press tours, and he was dealing with personal issues at the time. His marriage was falling apart, and he was drinking heavily. The stress of it all got to him, and he had a mental breakdown on set.

Pesci ended up checking himself into a psychiatric hospital for several months. He eventually recovered and returned to acting, but he's never been as successful as he was in the 1990s. casino

There's no doubt that Casino was one of the most intense movies ever made. It took a toll on all of the actors involved, and Joe Pesci was no exception. He paid the price for his performance with a nervous breakdown that nearly ruined his career.
