#  Arkansas AG Issues Opinion On Internet Gambling

The Arkansas Attorney General issued an opinion on internet gambling stating that it is currently illegal in the state. This comes as a bit of a surprise since many other states have legalized at least some form of internet gambling.

In the opinion, the AG cites the 2006 federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) as the source of authority for the illegality of internet gambling in Arkansas. This law prohibits financial institutions from processing payments related to illegal gambling activities.

The opinion also points out that there are no specific laws in Arkansas that authorize or regulate internet gambling. Therefore, any form of internet gambling would be illegal under current state law.

This position is not new for the Arkansas Attorney General. In fact, the office has taken this stance on internet gambling for several years now. However, this is the first time that the opinion has been written up in a formal legal document.

So far, there has been no indication that the Arkansas legislature plans to address this issue in the near future. This means that Arkansans who want to gamble online will need to do so in states where it is legal.

#  Arkansas Lottery Commission Gives Thumbs Up To Online Poker 

On Thursday, the Arkansas Lottery Commission unanimously voted in favor of a resolution that would allow for online poker within the state. This is seen as a big win by many in the industry, as Arkansas has been one of the more resistant states when it comes to gambling expansion.

The resolution now goes to the state legislature, where it will need to be approved before anything can happen. Even if it does get approved, there is no timeline currently in place for when online poker might become available in Arkansas.

This news comes on the heels of a similar resolution being passed in Iowa. That means that not only are two of the most conservative states in terms of gambling now moving forward with online poker, but they are also doing so through resolutions and not legislation. This could be an attempt by both states to avoid any possible legal challenges from the gambling industry.

Arkansas has been home to some of the most vocal anti-poker advocates in the country. That’s led to very little progress on the issue over the past few years. But with Thursday’s vote, things may be starting to change.

There is still a lot of work to be done before online poker becomes a reality in Arkansas, but this is a major step in the right direction.

#  No Comment Necessary: Arkansas Clarifies stance on online gambling 


Arkansas has become the latest US state to clarify its stance on online gambling, following a move by the state's governor to sign two new bills into law.

As reported by local media outlet Arkansas Online, the two new bills - HB1702 and HB1703 - were both signed into law by Governor Asa Hutchinson last week. The bills lay out the framework for how online gambling will be treated in the state, with a particular focus on how it will be regulated and taxed.

The new laws make it clear that only licensed casinos in Arkansas will be able to offer online gambling services to residents of the state. In addition, all gambling operators must pay a 20% tax on gross gaming revenue. This is in line with other US states that have legalised online gambling, such as New Jersey and Nevada.

Commenting on the news, Governor Hutchinson said: "This is an important step for Arkansas as we work to provide additional entertainment options for our citizens while also ensuring that appropriate safeguards are in place."

The signing of the new bills into law comes at a time when there is growing interest in online gambling in the US. Several states have already legalised some form of online gambling, including New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware. And there are now moves afoot in a number of other states to follow suit.

#  AG says yes to internet gambling in Arkansas

Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge says she will not oppose legalized internet gambling in the state. The announcement was made Wednesday, and it clears the way for lawmakers to move ahead with a proposed constitutional amendment on the issue.

“After careful consideration of the legal issues involved, I have concluded that the state should not take actions to prohibit or hinder Arkansans from participating in lawful internet gambling activities,” Rutledge said in a statement.

The proposal would allow people 21 years or older to gamble online through licensed vendors. Arkansas would join a growing number of states that offer some form of internet gambling.

The amendment’s sponsor, Rep. Robin Lundstrum, praised Rutledge’s decision and said she is “confident that we have crafted a measure that will be successful and provide much-needed revenue to our state.”

Critics of the proposal argue that it could lead to more problem gambling, but Lundstrum said her team has addressed those concerns by including measures to protect consumers.

If approved by voters, Arkansas would become the first Southern state to legalize internet gambling.

#  Arkansas Opens Door For Internet Gambling

The Natural State of Arkansas has taken a step forward in legalizing internet gambling. The state’s Racing Commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to allow Oaklawn Racing and Gaming, located in Hot Springs, to offer casino games online.

This move by the commission makes Arkansas the second state after Delaware to legalize online gambling. Under the new rules, only Oaklawn patrons physically located in Arkansas would be able to gamble online. This limitation is designed to comply with a 2006 federal law that prohibits most forms of internet gambling.

Oaklawn is expected to offer casino games such as blackjack, slots, and roulette within the next few months. In order to gamble online, residents of Arkansas will need to create an account with Oaklawn and deposit money into the account.

Some skeptics believe that this move by the Racing Commission will lead to more widespread gambling in the state. However, others believe that it will bring much-needed revenue to Oaklawn and other casinos in Arkansas.
