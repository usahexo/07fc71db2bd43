#  What tools do I need to get started?

You will need a few tools to get started in woodworking. The most important tool is a sturdy workbench. This will give you a solid surface to work on and keep your tools organized. You may also want to invest in a good saw, such as a table saw or miter saw. Other basic tools include a drill, clamps, screwdrivers, and chisels.

Once you have the necessary tools, you can start experimenting with different projects. One of the easiest projects is making a simple box. Measure the desired dimensions of the box and cut the pieces from your lumber using a saw. Drill holes for screws or nails, then assemble the pieces using clamps. Finally, sand the project until it is smooth.

If you are looking for more challenging projects, there are plenty of options available online or in woodworking magazines. You can build furniture, like chairs or tables, or try your hand at carpentry by building a birdhouse or a shed. The possibilities are endless, so don't be afraid to experiment!
